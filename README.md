## 🔍 Project Overview

GameGraph is an advanced analytics platform that models gaming communities as interconnected networks, revealing the hidden social structures that drive player engagement and game success. By treating players, games, features, and discussions as nodes in a complex graph, GameGraph uncovers influential patterns and predictive insights that traditional analytics miss.

The platform leverages cutting-edge graph theory, node embeddings, and community detection algorithms to transform player interaction data into strategic intelligence for game development, marketing, and community management.

### 🎯 Key Features

- **Cross-Platform Graph Database**: Unified representation of player interactions across Reddit, Discord, Steam, official forums, and in-game social features
- **Influence Mapping**: Identification of key community members who drive sentiment and adoption
- **Community Structure Detection**: Automated discovery of subcommunities and interest groups
- **Temporal Graph Analysis**: Evolution of community structures over time, especially around game events
- **Graph Embeddings**: Vector representations of players that capture behavior patterns and preferences
- **Information Flow Simulation**: Predictive modeling of how trends, opinions, and memes spread through player networks
- **Interactive Visualization Engine**: Explorable 3D network visualizations with filtering and pattern highlighting

## 🕹️ Use Cases

## 🧠 Graph Analysis Methodology

GameGraph implements sophisticated graph algorithms tuned specifically for gaming communities:

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - Players, games, features, and content as nodes
   - Interactions, similarities, and relationships as edges
   - Rich attribute sets for contextual analysis

2. **Community Detection**:
   - Multi-resolution community detection to identify structures at different scales
   - Overlapping community models that allow players to belong to multiple interest groups
   - Temporal community tracking to monitor evolution

3. **Node Embedding**:
   - Random walk-based methods capturing structural equivalence
   - Graph neural networks incorporating node attributes
   - Knowledge graph embeddings for semantic relationships

4. **Influence Modeling**:
   - Eigenvector and PageRank-based centrality measures
   - Information diffusion simulations using IC and LT models
   - Reinforcement learning for optimizing influence strategies

5. **Predictive Analytics**:
   - Link prediction for forecasting new relationships
   - Node classification for player behavior prediction
   - Graph classification for community health assessment
